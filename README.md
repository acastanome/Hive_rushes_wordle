# Wordle â™Ÿ

For this project we were randomly paired with another student, and given 48h to code a wordle-assistant for the web-based word game Wordle.
As a bonus, we could do a wordle-player.

wordle-assistant gives you a list of words to choose from, based on the feedback received from the real game.
wordle-player suggest the most likely word to win the game, taking into consideration the feedback the real game gives each round.


## Usage

Both wordle-assistant and wordle-player are coded in C and made to run on Mac iOS.

To use them, you will need to have a game opened simultaneously.

You can find the wordle game of the day here: [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle)

After you clone the repository:

1. To compile: run "make"
2. Two executables will be compiled:
	- wordle-assistant
 	- wordle-player
3. Run the executable of your choice without any arguments ./wordle-assistant or ./wordle-player
    Instructions will be displayed after running the program.
4. Have fun!

<!--
## Improvement ideas:

    1. Adding the possibility of viewing the game rules and goals that apply to our version before starting the game.
    2. The interface's usability could be improved by simpifying the input method.
