	RUSHES - WORDLE

Both wordle-assistant and wordle-player are made to run on Mac iOS.
To use them, you will need to have a game opened simultaneously; you can find the wordle game of the day in www.nytimes.com/games/wordle

1. To compile: run "make"

2. Two executables will be compiled:
  - wordle-assistant
  - wordle-player

3. Run the executable of your choice without any arguments. Instructions will be displayed after running the program.

   Have fun!
